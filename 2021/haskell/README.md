# Advent of Code 2021 In Haskell

To run the tests you will need HUnit. I have used `cabal` to [install](https://gist.github.com/peteanning/e3cb8c9aef4318cbaf46d5e1abf3d06a) the HUnit
dependencies. So far only one other package Data.List.Split with `cabal install
--lib split` as Haskell does not have any built-in String manipulation
functions.
